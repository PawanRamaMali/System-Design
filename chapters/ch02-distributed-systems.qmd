# Distributed Systems & Core Principles

## What is a Distributed System?

A **distributed system** is any system that includes multiple components residing on multiple machines, coordinating through some mechanism (like message passing) to achieve a common goal.

Modern web applications are inherently distributed, with components like:

* Web servers
* Application servers
* Databases
* Cache servers
* Load balancers
* Message queues

All working together to serve user requests.

## The 3 Core Principles of Distributed Systems

When designing distributed systems, three fundamental principles guide our architectural decisions:

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle

**Each component in the system should have a single job to perform.**

This principle ensures that components are:

* Easier to understand
* Simpler to test
* More maintainable
* Independently deployable

**Example:**

Instead of having one service that handles user authentication, sends emails, and processes payments, separate these into:

* Authentication Service
* Email Service
* Payment Service

Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility.

### 2. No Single Point of Failure Principle

**The system should never have any component whose failure will result in the failure of the entire system.**

Achieving this requires:

* Redundancy at every level
* Replication of critical components
* Graceful degradation
* Failover mechanisms

**Strategies:**

* Multiple load balancers in active-active or active-passive configuration
* Database replication with automatic failover
* Redundant network paths
* Multi-region deployment

### 3. No Bottleneck Principle

**The system should not have performance bottlenecks that limit scalability.**

To achieve this:

* Design for horizontal scaling
* Distribute load across multiple instances
* Use asynchronous processing where appropriate
* Monitor and identify bottlenecks early

**Common Bottlenecks:**

* Single database instance
* Synchronous processing of long-running tasks
* Insufficient network bandwidth
* CPU or memory constraints on a single machine

**Solutions:**

* Database sharding or read replicas
* Message queues for async processing
* Content delivery networks (CDN)
* Horizontal scaling with load balancing

## Guide for System Design

When approaching a system design problem, follow this systematic process:

### 1. Requirement Analysis

**Functional Requirements:** What should the system do?

* Define core features
* List user actions
* Specify system behaviors

**Non-Functional Requirements:** How should the system behave?

* Performance targets (latency, throughput)
* Scalability requirements
* Availability targets (99.9%, 99.99%)
* Security requirements
* Compliance needs

### 2. API Design

Define the interfaces exposed to the outside world:

* API endpoint names
* HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Request parameters
* Response formats
* Error handling
* Authentication/authorization

**Example:**

```
POST /api/v1/users
Request: { "username": "john", "email": "john@example.com" }
Response: { "id": "123", "username": "john", "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" }
```

### 3. Define Data Model

Create a representation of:

* Object data structures
* Associations between objects
* Validation rules
* Constraints

**Example:**

```
User:
  - id (UUID, primary key)
  - username (string, unique, indexed)
  - email (string, unique)
  - created_at (timestamp)
  - updated_at (timestamp)
```

### 4. High-Level Design

Create a diagram showing:

* Component blocks (load balancers, servers, databases, caches)
* Data flow between components
* External integrations
* Network boundaries

The high-level design visualizes how data flows from entry point to database and back.

**Components typically include:**

* Load balancers
* Web servers
* Application servers
* Databases
* Caches (Redis, Memcached)
* Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
* CDN
* Object storage

### 5. Scale the Design

After creating the initial design, optimize for scale:

* Identify bottlenecks
* Add caching layers
* Implement database sharding
* Use read replicas
* Add CDN for static assets
* Implement horizontal scaling
* Consider geographic distribution

**Questions to ask:**

* Can the system handle 10x current load?
* What happens when a component fails?
* Where are the performance bottlenecks?
* How do we handle peak traffic?

## Summary

Understanding these core principles and following a systematic design process provides a strong foundation for building distributed systems. The following chapters will explore specific components and patterns that implement these principles in practice.
